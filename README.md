EOOS Automotive is a system for **cross-platform development** of applications in **automotive sphere** 
which is developed within **ISO C++ standards**, complied with **MISRA C++:2008** and 
**AUTOSAR C++14 Coding Guidelines**, and relies on **ISO 26262**

EOOS provides API to develop embedded software for **real time safety-critical systems** and can be **ported** 
not only **on many MCUs and DSPs**, but also **supports POSIX and WIN32 systems**.

This **EOOS Sample Applications** give fast start for developing **safety-critical applications**. 
Using EOOS, you can **develop business-logic** of application on **any Linux or Windows operating systems**, 
and after easily **debug and test** it either on **real hardware under EOOS Automotive RTâ„¢**, or on **a safety-certified OS** like **QNX**.

The sample applications built within an EOOS Automotive system which can be:
- **[EOOS Automotive WIN32](https://gitflic.ru/project/baigudin-software/eoos-project-if-win32)**
- **[EOOS Automotive POSIX](https://gitflic.ru/project/baigudin-software/eoos-project-if-posix)**
- **EOOS Automotive RT** migration soon based on [BOOS Core R3](https://gitflic.ru/project/baigudin/boos-core-rev3).
